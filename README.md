# Gridshells-EQCS

Linear and nonlinear finite element analysis of grid shells with a planar square boundary and with various span, span-to-height ratio, grid density, and circular hollow cross-section sizes. With the analysis, the internal forces and the ultimate load are determined. The results are investigated based on the equivalent continuum shell theory. Based on the results, a preliminary desing method is proposed. This study is detailed in Section 4 of my dissertation submitted for the degree of PhD at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Guide to folders:

- Linear: Jupyter files for section 4.2.2 of dissertation;

- Nonlinear: Jupyter files for section 4.2.3 of dissertation;

- Desing curves: Jupyter files for sections 4.2.4-4.2.6 of dissertation;

- Saved results: all analysis results of the above sections;

- TEKNO: pyhton functions and objects utilzed by the above Jupyter files. 

The Jupyter files can either rerun the analyis, or it can load the saved results.

All finite element analysis are performed using OpenSeesPy: https://openseespydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
